 Corner cases.
 You may assume that the constructor receives an n-by-n array,
 containing the n2 integers between 0 and n2 âˆ’ 1,
 where 0 represents the blank square. 
 
 Performance requirements.
 Your implementation should have all Board methods in time proportional to n^2
 (or better) in the worst case.
